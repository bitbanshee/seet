# Seet

A system designed to help people and companies tracking products and belongings.

For instance, **people are not belongings or products**.

# Motivation

Good news: I'm building this system as a final work to finally get the Electrical Engineering undergraduate degree.

Bad news: yes, **Seet** comes from **see it**, I couldn't help it. And I'm still doing a logo for it. #peace
